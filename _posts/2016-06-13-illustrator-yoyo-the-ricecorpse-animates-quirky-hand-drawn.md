  Blending her original photography with hand-drawn illustrations in Photoshop,
  animator Yoyo the Ricecorpse creates quirky ghost-like characters that live in
  a world where anime meets Roger Rabbit. Each animation is limited to a single
  animated GIF that sees her doughy characters living in teapots or lounging
  around urban backdrops in photos taken from Yoyo's travels to Tokyo.
