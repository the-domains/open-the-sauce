# Live in a Studio Ghibli movie

<article style=""><img src="http://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/yoyo-og.jpg" /><h1>Illustrator 'Yoyo the Ricecorpse' Animates Quirky Hand-Drawn Characters With Her Original Photography</h1><p>Blending her original photography with hand-drawn illustrations in Photoshop, animator Yoyo the Ricecorpse creates quirky ghost-like characters that live in a world where anime meets Roger Rabbit. Each animation is limited to a single animated GIF that sees her doughy characters living in teapots or lounging around urban backdrops in photos taken from Yoyo's travels to Tokyo.</p></article>

The beautiful characters above are what I typically imagine good companion AR would look and feel like. 

Like living in a Studio Ghibli film. When coupled with the appropriate AI and the requisite pattern matching smarts I feel as if the possibilities are endless. 

Child minding, Elderly care, disease detection and early warning, a replacement for most if not all simple retail interactions.

Imagine if you will, walking into a store, putting on some glasses (or perhaps just accepting and invitation on your existing pair and then discussing your colour and clothing preferences with a life sized talking unicorn... No more "you looook great in that" from young judgemental shop assistants who need a sale.
